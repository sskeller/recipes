Sherried 'Shrooms'
=======

Ingredients
-----------

Amount   | Ingredient
-------- | ---------------------
10-ounce | white mushrooms
2 tbsp   | butter
1/4 cup  | reduced sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup  | sherry
pinch    | chopped f"pumvisible() ? "resh chives (optional)
to taste | salt
to taste | pepper

Directions
----------

Pull off the mushroom stems from their caps.  Melt the butter in a skillet just 
large enough to hold the mushrooms in a single layer over medium heat.  Just 
when it starts to foam, add the mushrooms with the top of the caps facing down.
The butter will start to brown--that's fine, just turn down the heat a little if
it starts to get too brown.  Cook until the mushrooms are golden brown, about
4 minutes, then flip them and cook for a couple minutes on the other side.  
  
Pour the broth and sherry into the pan, crank the heat to high, and bring to a 
boil.  Boil until there's just enough syrupy liquid left to coat the mushrooms.
Season them with salt and pepper to taste and then pour the mushrooms onto a 
plate or shallow serving dish.  Top with fresh chives.  Serve warm or at room
temperature.
