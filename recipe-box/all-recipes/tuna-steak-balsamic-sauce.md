=======

##Ingredients

Amount     | Ingredient
---------- | ---------------------
1 1/2 lb   | Ahi Tuna steaks (about 4 steaks)
1 1/2 tsp  | sea salt
1 tsp      | ground coriander
1 tsp      | paprika
1/4 tsp    | cayenne pepper
1 1/2 tbsp | coarse black pepper
2 tbsp     | vegetable oil
6 tbsp     | balsamic vinegar
1          | lemon juiced (about 2 tbsp)
1 clove    | garlic, peeled
4          | lemon wedges (optional garnish)

##Directions

Place the balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Simmer until the mixture reduces by half.  Turn off heat and reserve until needed (can be served cold).  

In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, coriander, paprika and cayenne.  Sprinkle the spice mixture on all sides of the steaks gently pressing it in.  

Place a think bottomed frying pan or a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan.  Heat until smoking then add the tuna to the pan.  Sear on both sides for about 1 minute per side.  

Remove to a cutting board.  Slice each steak diangonally into 4-5 slices.  Serve with sauce drizzled over the tuna or along side it.  Garnish with lemon wedge if desired.

##Tips

1.  Don't over season!  The measurements are for 4 tuna steaks, if making only 2, cut the dry ingredients in half.
